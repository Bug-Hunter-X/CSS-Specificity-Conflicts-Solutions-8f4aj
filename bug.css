The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected styling issues when selectors have equal specificity. For instance, two rules targeting the same element with the same specificity might conflict, leading to unpredictable rendering depending on which rule is parsed last. This can be challenging to debug, as the browser's developer tools may not always highlight the conflicting rules clearly.
