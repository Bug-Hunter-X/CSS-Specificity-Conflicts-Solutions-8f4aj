To address this issue, increase the specificity of one of the conflicting selectors. There are several ways to do this: 

1. **Increase Specificity with a More Specific Selector:** Instead of using a general class selector like `.element`, use a more specific selector such as `.container .element`. 
2. **Use the `!important` Flag (Use Cautiously):**  In cases where increasing specificity isn't feasible or practical, you can use the `!important` flag. This should be used cautiously, as overusing it can lead to maintainability issues.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container .element {
  color: blue !important;
}
.element {
  color: red;
}
```
By making the selector more specific or by employing the `!important` flag, we can ensure that the correct style is applied to the `.element`.
